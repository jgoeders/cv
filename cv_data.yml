  My main research focuses are the Internet of Things, remote sensor deployments, and wireless network management. I am interested in building real systems that enhance and extend wireless networks. I am passionate about measuring and understanding air quality to help improve health.

# As part of an NIH grant, I designed, built, and deployed an IoT architecture for in-home environmental sensors for epidemiological studies.

#         description: |
#           Designed and built a framework for easy deployment of IoT in-home
#           sensor network for epidemiologists. The framework uses Raspberry
#           Pis and open source software to interoperate with many different
#           types of IoT sensors. It allows for easy experimentation and data
#           collection. The system has been deployed in multiple homes in
#           Utah as part of a pediatric asthma research study.
