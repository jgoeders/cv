research_interests: >
  My main research focuses are the Internet of Things, remote sensor deployments, and wireless network management. I am interested in building real systems that enhance and extend wireless networks. I am passionate about measuring and understanding air quality to help improve health.

# As part of an NIH grant, I designed, built, and deployed an IoT architecture for in-home environmental sensors for epidemiological studies.

#         description: |
#           Designed and built a framework for easy deployment of IoT in-home
#           sensor network for epidemiologists. The framework uses Raspberry
#           Pis and open source software to interoperate with many different
#           types of IoT sensors. It allows for easy experimentation and data
#           collection. The system has been deployed in multiple homes in
#           Utah as part of a pediatric asthma research study.

#           an easy to use tool to export data from the database, peak detect
#           algorithm for anomaly detection, a participant text notifications
#           system to alert and receive feedback from participants, and an API

    url: https://byu-cpe.github.io/ecen427/
    bullets:
      - Developed major revisions to the lab content of the class in conjunction with the instructor, Brad Hutchings.
      - New lab content focuses on development of user space and kernel code for Linux embedded systems.
      - "New labs give students a full-stack experience: creating a new digital circuit IP through both Verilog and high-level synthesis (HLS), integrating it into a Linux system, developing a Linux kernel driver, and finally integrating it into application code."

  - name: "ECEN 625: High-Level Digital Design Automation (BYU)"
    url: https://byu-cpe.github.io/ecen625/
    bullets:
      - Major revisions of existing course to introduce new assignments, lecture material, current research topics, and hands-on experience with major commercial tools.
      - Developed five new assignments which give students experience with commercial designs, high-level synthesis algorithms, large open-source tools, including the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

  - name: "BYU Computing Boot Camp"
    url: https://byu-cpe.github.io/ComputingBootCamp/
    bullets:
      - In conjunction with other faculty members, we created a summer boot camp experience for undergraduate research students.  This boot camp consists of faculty lectures three times per week, with followup student activities.
      - Various modules focus on software development skills (Git, Github, Makefiles, etc.), as well as commercial and academic FPGA tools.
      - In 2021 we had over 30 undergraduate students participate.

  - name: "ECEN 330: Intro to Embedded Systems Programming (BYU)"
    url: http://ecen330-lin.groups.et.byu.net/wiki/doku.php
    bullets:
      - Migrated all labs and development infrastructure to use Linux-based, open-source, command-line tools.  
      - Created automated testing, submission, and grading infrastructure to alleviate teaching assistant burden, and provide more time for one-on-one student interactions.

  - name: "ECEN 220: Fundamentals of Digital Design (BYU)"
    url: http://ecen220wiki.groups.et.byu.net/
    bullets:
      - Created several new labs (Codebreaker, Pong) designed to provide a more engaging student experience.

  - name: "EECE 381: Computer Systems Design Studio (UBC)"
    bullets:
      - Co-developed with Professor Steve Wilton at The University of British Columbia.
      - Project-based course designed to give students real-world technical project skills.  Students work in groups to identify a real-world market, identify constraints and requirements, plan project milestones, implement hardware and software, and present and report on their accomplishments.  
      - "Technical topics: Rapid development of configurable hardware systems using commercial tools (Quartus/Qsys), embedded software development (FPGAs, Raspberry Pi, ARM), mobile applications (Android), and the integration of such systems."
